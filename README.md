## Design of the tool
### Design
![UML Diagram](/img/ProjectUMLManually.png "UML Diagram")
As the UML Diagram shows above, the project consists of two major parts.

The first part is designed to read code from specified java files to parse them using [asm](http://asm.ow2.org/download/index.html).
Since asm is designed in visitor pattern, we need to implement its `visit` methods for ClassDeclarations, ClassFields and ClassMethods.
It consists of the following packages:
* ragdoll.app
* ragdoll.util
* ragdoll.asm.*

The second part is designed to use our own visitor pattern to output the class structure in either [GraphicViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) format, or [SDEdit](http://sdedit.sourceforge.net/) format.
It consists of the following packages:
* ragdoll.code.*.api
* ragdoll.code.*.impl
* ragdoll.code.visitor.api
* ragdoll.code.visitor.impl

Overall, the project uses Decorator Pattern as well as two aspects of Visitor Patterns.

### Evolution of the design
#### Milestone 1 & 2
In Milestone 1, we considered possible needs in the future to draw more types of arrows. Thus, we modified a little bit of Visitor Pattern in `GVOutputStream` class and allow it to visit `String`s. Therefore, in Milestone 2, we don't see a strong demand of completely redesigning of our design patterns. We choose to keep using our existing one.
#### Milestone 3
In Milestone 3, we recognized the need to properly extend our project's structure. We went through a brainstorm activity during the meeting, and came with the following reasonings:
* This milestone is about to build an entirely different tool.
* At the first glance, we thought we may share some data structure or common classes with the existing one. Indeed, we figured out that the following classes and interfaces could be shared:
 * ragdoll.app.Ragdoll
 * ragdoll.code.visitor.api.IVisitor
 * ragdoll.code.visitor.impl.AOutputStream
 * Some test cases
* For some data structure, such as `ragdoll.code.uml.api.IMethod`, we firstly tended to reuse it in SD tool. However, it added a level of confusion in implementing `Method` class because it doesn't make sense to let a UML drawing tool to have getter and setter to deal with method's depth. It also doesn't make sense to let a SD drawing tool to keep track of method's access level and exceptions, because as long as the code compiles, we will just traverse the compiled code and form the [Call Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph).  
Therefore, we kept a low level of coupling between these two drawing tools. These are indicated by their own package names.

#### Milestone 4
In Milestone 4, we added some methods in IClass and IClassDeclaration to support detection for Singleton Pattern. We find that our design allows us to make modifications without changing the structure of the design.

#### Milestone 5
In Milestone 5, we restructured the pattern detection design. By using our new design, a client can add pattern detector and output the detected patterns using their customized format easily and dynamically. Say a client wants to add Singleton pattern detector, and output it using the Ragdoll format. All s/he needs to do are:
* Create a SingletonPattern that extends APatternDetector
* Create a RagdollFormatConsumer that implements IFormatConsumer
* Create a RagdollOutputStream that extends AOutputStream
* Register them in client driver and PatternController
*Note*: The internal data structure for storing Pattern instances is `Pattern`.

#### Milestone 6
In Milestone 6, we use the same design pattern that we refactored since Milestone 5. We are proud to say that we benefit a lot from the change we made. Here's what we changed:
* Create a CompositePattern that extends APatternDetector
* Register CompositePattern in client driver and PatternController

### Design Principles
The project follows the following design principles:
* *Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.* According to the above discussion, we separated the read-in functionality from the write-out functionality.
* *Program to an interface, not an implementation.* As the UML diagram shows, we are programming to various interfaces that well represents the key components of the project, such as IVisitor, ITraverser, and IClassComponents.
* *Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact*. Since we are using the Visitor Pattern which has the Message Coupling, we are achieving the loose coupling in our design.
* *Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.* The Decorator Pattern we are using allows us to wrap up any level of visitors without modifying the existing code.
* *Each method should be either a command or a query.* We tried our best to make methods that we implemented in the project to either be a Command Method (Performs an action but has no return value) or a Query Method (Returns data but has no side effects).

## Usage / Instructions
### Before we start
Please make sure that you have installed [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

Also please make sure that you have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Get the code
In command line console, type:
```
git clone git@github.com:SashaMoe/Ragdoll.git
```

Now you should be able to `cd` into the folder:
```
cd
```

You should now have the entire project.

### Build the project
Import the project into your Eclipse. Then, single click on the project (Ragdoll), and choose `"Project" -> "Clean.."`. This will let Eclipse build the `bin/` folder.

### Run the code
To run the code using `java`, type:
```
java -classpath ./bin:./lib/asm-all-5.0.4.jar ragdoll.app.Ragdoll <diagram_type> [<arguments>, ...]
```
For `<diagram_type>`, you can replace it with the following:
* **UML**: Generate the UML Diagram. Here, the arguments are `[<package_name>, ...]`.
* **SD**: Generate the Sequance Diagram. Here, the argument is `<fully_qualified_method_signature> [<max_depth>]`

For `[<package_name>, ...]`, you can replace it with one or more package names, and our program will traverse your entire package and get all classes in it except classes for testing purposes.

For `<fully_qualified_method_signature>`, you must use this format: `<package_name>.<class_name>.<method_name>([<param_type>, ...])`

For `<max_depth>`, you can specify the maximum depth that the program will traverse, or you can not specify it and it will use the default value `5`.

For example, by typing:
```
java -classpath ./bin:./lib/asm-all-5.0.4.jar UML ragdoll.app.Ragdoll ragdoll
```
This will output the Ragdoll's generated UML textual representation in GraphicViz image format to the console.

And by typing:
```
java -classpath ./bin:./lib/asm-all-5.0.4.jar SD ragdoll.app.Ragdoll ragdoll.asm.sd.test.sample.ClassA.methodA(int)
```
This will output the `ragdoll.asm.sd.test.sample.ClassA.methodA`'s generated Sequence Diagram in SDEdit format to the console.

### Generate the image
#### Generate UML image
To generate the UML image, type:
```
<ragdoll_command> | dot -Tpng -o <output_png_path>
```
For `<ragdoll_command>`, replace it with the command described above.

For `<output_png_path>`, replace it with the path of the output png file.

For example, by typing:
```
java -classpath ./bin:./lib/asm-all-5.0.4.jar ragdoll.app.Ragdoll UML ragdoll | dot -Tpng -o outputUML.png
```
This will generate a png image file `outputUML.png` (the UML diagram) in your current directory.

#### Generate SD image
To generate the SD image, type:
```
<ragdoll_command> > <temp_sd_file_store_path>; java -jar lib/sdedit-4.01.jar -o demo/test.png -t png <temp_sd_file_store_path>
```
You can specify the `<temp_sd_file_store_path>` whereever and whatever you want.

For example, by typing:
```
java -classpath ./bin:./lib/asm-all-5.0.4.jar ragdoll.app.Ragdoll SD "java.util.Collections.shuffle(java.util.List)" 2 > demo/test.sd; java -jar lib/sdedit-4.01.jar -o demo/test.png -t png demo/test.sd
```
This will generate a png image file `test.png` (the SD diagram) in your `demo/` directory.
