A. Adapter
  Iterate through concrete classes, and see if a class satisfy the following requirements
    i. It implements one or more Interface
    ii. Its constructor takes and stores one or more classes in the scope (L: List of such classes)
    iii. In the methods that are from the Interface, count the method calls for each classes in L
    iv. If there exists one class that is used in every method that are from the Interface
      a. The interface is <<target>>
      b. The class is <<adapter>>
      c. The class where adapter stores is <<adaptee>>

      (?) What if more than one "adaptee-like" classes exist?
          In different patterns
      (?) What if the "adaptee" is not called in every method that are from the Interface?
          Add a threshold parameter / constant to the pattern detector
      (?) Could the adapter be an abstract class?
          No
      (?) What if the "adapter" implements more than one interface?
          Possible
      (?) What if the adapter is another system's adaptee?
          Possible

B. Decorator
  Iterate through classes & abstract classes, and see if one satisfy the following requirements
    i. It implements one interface or extends one class
    ii. From the top of its inheritance / implement chain in the scope, see if its constructor takes one of it as parameter
      If true, temporarily mark it as the <<component>>
    iii. Iterate through all methods that is overridden from the component
      If in all methods, there exists one method call that has the same name as its name, then itself and its subclasses are all decorators.

    (?) Is InputStreamReader using an decorator pattern? http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/java/io/InputStreamReader.java
        Half Adapter, Half Decorator
    (?) What about its super classes?
        No
    (?) Say we have an abstract class A that takes an interface as parameter, stores it in a protected field P, implement methodA() in the interface, and its subclass B implement methodB() in the interface where it delegates that to P, while its subclass C implement methodB() by simply throwing the UnsupportedOperationException. What are decorators?

Ragdoll [√]
  1. Create PatternController [√]
  2. Add all APatternDetector.class [√]
  3. Add all IFormatConsumer.class [√]
  4. PatternController.detectAllPatterns() [√]

PatternController (old PatternDetector) [√]
  - detectAllPatterns() [√]
    1. Construct all IPatternDetectors by passing in the IClassInfo [√]
    2. Create and store HashMap<patternType, List<Pattern>> [√]
    3. Call parse() on IFormatConsumers by passing in the hash map [√]

APatternDetector (old IPattern)
  Need to register in PatternController
  - List<Pattern> [√]
  - ONLY Constructor(IClassInfo) [√]
    call detectPattern() [√]
      that detects all patterns and store into Pattern list. [√]

IFormatConsumer [√]
  Need to register in PatternController [√]
  - Singleton [√]
  - parse(HashMap<patternType, List<Pattern>>) [√]
    Store the output info somehow that matches the logic in FormatOutputStream visitor [√]

Pattern [√]
  Stores the detected pattern [√]
  - HashMap<className, role> [√]
  - HashMap<List[fromClassName, toClassName], relation> [√]

FormatOutputStream [√]
  1. IFormatConsumer.getInstance() [√]
  2. Use its data to render specific patterns [√]
